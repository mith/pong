# Pong

This is a simple Pong clone I wrote for some practice with the Bevy engine and Nix. It serves as a simple example of how use Nix to build Rust packages for webassembly, letting Nix manage the toolchain and other dependencies.

## How to run

### Web

Play the game [here](https://mith.github.io/pong)

### Nix

To run the game locally using Nix, run the following command:
```
nix run github:mith/pong
```
